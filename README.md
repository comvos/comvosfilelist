# comvosfilelist, a TYPO3 file list extension with DAM support and a special focus on security #

When it comes to file lists in TYPO3 we at comvos were
unhappy with the existing solutions concerning security,
feature-richness and quality of code.


For example, mm\_dam\_filelist was/is pretty powerful but lacks a clear, transparent
security policy and the codebase istn't very pretty. There are many others like
fefilebrowser with good intentions but big disadvantages. Comvosfilelist shall
be an alternative. Right now it does not have a lot of features, but it should
be a good, clean and secure start for a feature-rich filelist.


## Features ##

- security layer for file access
- file access is determined by page access rights (transparent and easy)
- secure thumbnails
- easy templating using twig (have a look at the [template documentation](doc/templating.md))
- usable with or without DAM
- observe directories with reports module to check security regularly
- basic compatibility with mm\_dam\_filelist (have a look at [mm\_dam\_filelist replacement documentation](doc/mm_dam_filelist-compatmode.md))

## Future and development ##

We are very motivated in supporting and improving this extension continuously. So please contact us in case of any bugs or feature requests. We would prefer if you used Github to make this process as transparent and well-documented as possible.

## About the extension structure ##

When developing this extension, we decided to go a new/different way by not using extbase or the old pi-base extension structure. Even though the extension is stable, it's also an experiment in the matter of structuring the code and the components used.

### Why we did't use extbase ###

After developing several extensions in extbase, we experienced several major disadvantages:

- Unfixed bugs in extbase stayed unfixed for a long time
- Performance was pretty bad in data-rich, complex systems even though optimizations have been made
- pretty far behind latest flow releases (what about Doctrine?)
- fluid has some very rough edges

### Why doctrine and twig ###

Instead of extbase we decided to use symfony2 components, using composer to build the extension. We only use Doctrine DBAL to ease database access (and keep complexity and dependency low). Twig is very powerful, has excellent documentation, and is easy to use and extend.

The controller functionality of the extension is provided by an oldschool pi-class bringing the components together.

The idea is: Extbase as well as 100% TYPO3 pi-base way might result in a lot of migration problems when updating to a new major release based on TYPO3 Flow. Building the extension with as little external dependencies as possible using state of the art components might be a better way.


Furthermore it's an experiment to see if this can be done in a reasonable amount of time and if it pays out in the end. Until now everything is looking pretty promising.

## Installation ##

When fetching the extension from github remember to install dependencies via [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)!

### 1. Secure your files ###

First thing you should do is to think about is security.


The most importent question is this:

***Which folders shall have restricted file access?***


As soon as you know this, you have to protect the folders through your http server, so that the server returns a 403 response when trying to directly access a file in the protected directories.

***You also have to protect "typo3temp/comvosfilelist"!***


### 2. Setup your webserver for streaming ###

By default comvosfilelist doesn't use the real file name when linking to files or thumbnails. Generated URLs have a defined structure that must be rewritten internally to enable TYPO3 / comvosfilelist to handle the file-streaming.

The pattern is:

`/comvosfilelist/<pageid>/<encryptedfilename>/<cHash>`

With apache the rewrite configuration looks like this:

`RewriteRule ^/comvosfilelist/(.*)/(.*)/(.*) /index.php?id=$1&tx_comvosfilelist_pi1[action]=stream&tx_comvosfilelist_pi1[file]=$2&cHash=$3 [L]`


### 3. Installing the extension ###

After installing the extension through the extension manager, you have to change some important settings.

1. The encryption key for the server-side file name encryption, to hide real file names.
2. A comma-seperated list containing all folders that have to be protected (used by the reports-module to check for correct directory protection)
3. The hostname that should be used by the status report to check for correct directory protection. (remember to change this when migrating from development enviroments)

From version 1.0.2 on you can activate a fake **mm\_dam\_filelist** plugin 
and let comvosfilelist render old **mm\_dam\_filelist** plugin content elements.
Have a look at the [mm\_dam\_filelist replacement documentation](doc/mm_dam_filelist-compatmode.md)
 to learn how this works.

In the reports section of your TYPO3 installation there should now be a section providing information about your protected folders and the "fileadmin" folder, which should be reachable any time. If the "fileadmin" folder is reported as unreachable you might have entered a wrong hostname in the extension configuration.

## Configuration ##

If everything worked out fine during the installation, you should now be able to add the new content element "Extended Filelist" to your pages.

Within the plugin's flexform you have few further configuration options.

### 1. Use DAM ?###

Whether or not to use DAM information. This can also be set in the typoscript setup:

`useDAM = false`

### 2. Template ###

The template to be used to render the file list. There are two templates (listview and singleview) that have to be present in one folder, which ist configured in typoscript-setup.

The default folder is defined in:

`templateFolders.default`

You can add more by defining other keys than *default*. For example:

`templateFolders.MyUniqueTemplateName `

To make them selectable in the flexform you have to add some lines to the **Page-TS** like:

`TCEFORM.tt_content.pi_flexform.comvosfilelist_pi1.sDEF.template {

  # Add templates to flexform dropdown
  addItems {    
    MyUniqueTemplateName = My template's descriptive title
  }

}`

For information about creating you own templates have a look at the [template documentation](doc/templating.md).

### Entries per page ###

Defines how many files are shown on each page, you can leave this empty to use the default typoscript setup:

`entriesPerPage = 30`

### File source - DAM category or directory ###

Finally you have to configure the file source for the plugin. It can be either a DAM category or a directory. If you select a DAM category it's your responsability that all files in the category are located within protected folders.

### File access ###

As the plugin streams the file to the client, setting the page access rights to the right feuser-group grants access to the listed files. ***If you dont't protect your page/plugin, your files are not protected either.***
